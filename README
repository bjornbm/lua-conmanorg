This is a collection of Lua 5.1 modules I've written.  Yes, they include
functionality found in other Lua modules like luasockets and luaposix.  I
wrote these not to reinvent the wheel (although I did) but to learn how to
program in Lua.  As such, I do find these modules useful and actually prefer
them to such modules as luasockets and luaposix. 

Now, because of the functionality overlap of some of these modules with
existing Lua modules, I decided to place them under a name that I know won't
conflict with existing modules.  I took a play out of the Java playbook and
placed all these modules under the "org.conman" table.
